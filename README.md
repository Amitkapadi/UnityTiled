# UnityTiled

An editor-only importer for bringin [Tiled](http://mapeditor.org) maps into Unity. Since we don't want to ship TMX files, everything is built out into standard Unity objects and the tools attempt to incorporate the best of Tiled with the best of Unity, such as leveraging Unity prefabs while allowing Tiled objects to override properties in the prefabs.

In essence, the importer converts maps from Tiled:

into objects in Unity:
